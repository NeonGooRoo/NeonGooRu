This is achieved mostly through a huge amount of language consumption in its various manifestations, in other words - <strong>&quot;immersion&quot;</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Immersion should take up most of the time you spend learning the language and it should bring you as much enjoyment as possible. There&#39;s no need to try to learn what you&#39;re not interested in. Put textbooks aside, enjoy and relax consuming the media. Yes, it will be difficult at first, but over time, it will require less and less effort and more and more opportunities will be available.</p></li><li><p>Immersion provides a better understanding of the language than textbooks. As Panates said:</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>The average 6-year-old Spanish child has more information about the Spanish language in their head than in all the books about Spanish published in the last 200 years.</p></blockquote><p>This doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t use any theoretical material for language learning at all; it means that you don&#39;t need to get carried away in them, hoping to perfectly understand the language. Nobody ever did and you won&#39;t too.</p>',5),q=a("<li><p>Interaction with the language occurs mainly in two forms: <strong>Input</strong> (e.g., listening, reading) and <strong>Output</strong> (e.g., speaking, writing). In the beginning (and as long as you can), you should spend time only on <strong>Input</strong>, because <strong>Output</strong> comes mostly by itself and doesn&#39;t help you to understand the language. &quot;What is this nonsense?&quot; - you might ask, but that&#39;s how it is. After thousands of hours media consumption in a new language, your brain subconsciously adapts to the structures of the new language and begins to understand how, what, and when to speak. At the same time, this will be much more natural than what textbooks or universities force you to pull out of yourself in the early stages of learning. Of course, you will still need to practice speech to speak fluently, but it will be a relatively easy and smooth process with enough input behind you. If you need to learn to speak as quickly as possible, you can try speaking from the very first day, but it will be much more difficult and there is a high risk of developing bad habits.</p></li><li><p>Input can and should be as <strong>conscious</strong> as possible, meaning that you understand most of what you are consuming and/or try to understand. Of course, at first this will be especially difficult, but it should not demotivate you from immersing. Find media that uses easier language, re-watch what you have already watched and remember well. But it is also important to try to understand what you are consuming. Simply putting a podcast in the background while working for 8 hours is not the same as 8 hours of conscious, thoughtful reading. You need to try to understand and pay attention to the media. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to consume what interests you. Just putting anime in the background while you study is not immersion. Yes, I further advise listening to podcasts in the background of chores, but these should not be chores that heavily occupy your mind, and it is still less effective than if you are focused specifically on immersion. Focused immersion &gt; language in the background &gt; nothing. By the way, it is impossible to learn a language in your sleep, so sleep normally.</p></li>",2),S=e("strong",null,"i+1 during immersion",-1),Y={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},E=a('<blockquote><p>&quot;input hypothesis&quot;: according to it, learners improve their knowledge of the language when they understand language input that is slightly beyond their current level. Krashen called this input level &quot;i+1&quot;, where &quot;i&quot; meant language input and &quot;+1&quot; meant the next stage of language acquisition.</p></blockquote><p>Simply put, <strong>i+1</strong> is when in a given sentence, only one language unit (word/grammar/something else) is unknown to you. For example, you probably understand what &quot;I am eating a sandwich&quot; means in English - it&#39;s a completely understandable sentence. But if you encounter &quot;I am eating natto&quot;, this would be an <strong>i+1</strong> sentence (assuming you don&#39;t know what onigiri is, but this is just an example). The more sentences you encounter that are <strong>i+1</strong>, the more productive the learning process is. And on this example it&#39;s obvious why <strong>i+1</strong> is so good, form the context you can deduct yourself that an &quot;natto&quot; is probably a food!</p><figure><img src="'+u+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>',3),P=e("li",null,[e("p",null,"Japanese should become a part of your life, but it should not overwhelm you.

Simply. Kanji almost never needs to be understood out of the context of words. Kanji are used to write words, so you need to learn words in their kanji form. For example:</p><p><strong>日本 [にほん]</strong> - a word consisting of 2 kanji. To learn it, you don&#39;t need to &quot;know&quot; the kanji <strong>日</strong> and <strong>本</strong>.</p><p>You simply try to remember its reading <strong>[にほん]</strong> and its meaning - Japan. This will be very convenient to do with flashcards.</p><p>&quot;Why not learn the kanji first, then the word?&quot;</p><p>Because it&#39;s less effective. You don&#39;t need to try to memorize kanji separately. It&#39;s a skill of little use when learning a real language. When Japanese people see <strong>日本</strong>, they don&#39;t think of this word as &quot;sun base&quot; or something like that; they only have one concept in their head - Japan. From childhood, they first learn the spoken form of the word, and then add the kanji. In our case, we simply learn the kanji form simultaneously with its &quot;phonetic&quot; form, which is relatively close to how the Japanese learn words. Of course, ideally, you can learn the word without kanji first, and then add the kanji, which will probably even help with listening comprehension, but in my opinion, that&#39;s just extra hassle.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard various nonsense about this, some say that when the Japanese hear a word, they break it down by composition and then get the meaning from its composition. This is just nonsense. They don&#39;t break down words like <strong>いなずま</strong>, and then imagine <strong>稲妻</strong> in their heads and rack their brains over what it means &quot;rice-wife&quot;. Just as you, when you hear the word &quot;паровоз&quot; (steam locomotive), don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a vehicle that carries steam. The specific type of transport that we refer to as &quot;паровоз&quot; immediately appears in your head.</p><p>Yes, learning words as combinations of kanji is fun, interesting, and fashionable, but it only works at the beginning when textbooks specifically give you words that are easily perceived through such logic. In the real world, one kanji can have several basic meanings, dozens of readings, and other subtleties that will simply break your head when memorizing words that don&#39;t fit within your understanding when using this method. Over time, the approach of learning without memorizing kanji will bring you more and more benefits, because you will encounter more and more words with unique or rare kanji. For example, words like <strong>薔薇</strong> will be easily remembered thanks to their uniqueness.</p><p>Actually knowing kanji may only be useful if you want to pass exams where you need to write by hand (a useless skill in the real world), or if there is a part with a kanji test where you need to distinguish 成績 or 成積 (a useless skill in the real world, because in practice there are very few such similar words and it&#39;s easier to understand the difference in specific cases).</p>",9),pe=a("<p>Over time, words with new and especially unique kanji will be something interesting and easy for you to remember, compared to yet another word-combination of old, familiar kanji.
